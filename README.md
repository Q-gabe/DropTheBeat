## _Drop The Beat_ - Redefining how we share the music we love.

Ever felt that _serene peace_ during a train ride or on a smooth drive at the hustle and bustle, just listening to your favourite track? Or maybe, that _pulse of adrenaline_ blasting your favourite _EDM_ hits while gaming it out at a LAN shop?

So have we! For [**Hack'n'Roll 2020**](https://hacknroll.nushackers.org/), our team built an application that enables anyone to share that audio-visual experience with others easily on the go. And so we proudly we present our multi-platform mobile application **Drop The Beat**!

* **Share your experience in real-time!** :clock1:
	* _Drops_ are updated with our backend in real-time to share your tags with others instantly!

## Roadmap Ahead

* We plan to increase the interactivity of our application with Spotify, so that Droppers can enjoy an even better user experience (Direct linking to songs, album crawling, etc.). 
* We hope to provide a temporary in-app channel (DropParties) for Droppers who are in the near vicinity to join, and stream music together! (Think Silent Disco but modular!) 
* Our idea banks are full and we are excited to work on the Drop The Beat even further!

## Development and Contributions
We built _Drop The Beat_ with:
* **Firebase** - Back-end for geolocation tags
* **Flutter** - Front-end mobile framework
* **Google Maps API** - Geolocation Processing
* **Spotify API** - Song search Processing

We welcome contributors to work on _Drop The Beat_ together with us! Feel free to make various improvements as you see fit, no matter how small! However, changes will be subject to approval through pull requests.
